# tetvis

tetvis is a HTML/CSS framework for visualizing tetris in your browser.

The goal is to create an easy-to-use system for communicating tetris strategies online.

Features that I think would make this project worthwhile:

* mobile-friendly
* compatible with major browsers
* better performance and versatility than the [popular system currently in use](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Template:Pfstart)
* easy-to-use authoring tool
* easily shareable
